### Overview
#### Easily Create API
With our powerful web application, you'll effortlessly create APIs in no time, empowering you to perform essential CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) on your data.

### Streamline Your Workflow with Ease
Effortlessly define your API structure, model your data, and let Dummy API builder handle the heavy lifting, so you can enjoy a streamlined workflow.

### Confidence in Data Manipulation
Dummy API builder equips you with the tools and functionality to manipulate your data confidently. It gives you full control over your data management tasks.

### Data Management
It offers an intuitive approach, eliminating unnecessary complexities and time-consuming processes. With Dummy API builder, you can make the most of your data without hassle.


### Requirements:
- Basic Programming knowledge
- Basic API knowledge(how to define relationships)

### Who this is for?
This tool allows you to create simple apis for consumption, thus providing a quick way of creating an api, and simple relationships. This tool is useful for 
- Frontend Developers who needs to quickly create an endpoint for testing the applications
- Backend developers who wants to create a large scale api and need to breakdown the workflow into simpler units (You can quickly create simple apis and create relationship between this apis for testing purposes in order to envision how to build the larger api service)
- Can be used in very small scale applications.

### Limitations
This tool is simple tool and you can also infer that from the title of the project. So before you consider using it here are the limitations
- Cannot be used in medium-large scale applications
- Cannot be used in small-scale applications that requires very complex api relationship
- Relationships such as many-many and one-one isn't implemented in v1(perhaps in v2)
- Rigidity in how you get back your data (little or no flexibilty to run complex queries) (perhaps in the coming versions)
- Endpoints are fixed and enforces strictly you follow the format in order to make most use of the api (we'll see that in the usage section of this docs)
- This application is still being tested and might break at any point
